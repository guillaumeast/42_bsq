## [3.2.0] - ~77 ms on 10,000 x 10,000 maps

- Implemented **single-row array `dp`** for faster updates:
	- Up-left = `dp->prev`
	- Up = `dp->tab[col]`
	- Left = `dp->tab[col - 1]`
	- `dp->prev` is set to `dp->tab[col]` before modification
- Added comments above each function

---

## [3.1.0] - ~87 ms on 10,000 x 10,000 maps

- Fine-tuned `parse_map.c` for _42 Norm_ compliance

---

## [3.0.0] - ~100 ms on 10,000 x 10,000 maps

### Optimizations

- Converted full size `int *` array into two little arrays of size row_len to optimize cache usage
- Optimized `if` statements order
- Removed `run_set_width()` and added `parse_row_0()` to avoid double read of row 0
- Tried _bitmask-based_ and _xor-based_ versions of the original _if-based_ `solve_cell()`
	- The goal was to reduce branch mispredictions using a _branchless_ comparison method
	- All three versions compile down to a **single `csel` instruction** with `-O1` or higher
	- _if-based_ and _xor-based_ versions run in **similar time** without optimization flags
	- _bitmask-based_ version runs **about 35 % slower** without optimization (due to the extra `mask` variable)
	- For **code readability**, the _if-based_ version remains the one used in the project
	- Added `branchless_comparison.md` to document the _bitmask-based_ and _xor-based_ approaches

### Bug fixes

- Fix multiple incorrect rules, maps and file path handling
-Changed `malloc(sizeof(type))` to `malloc(sizeof *p)` to prevent type mismatch errors and simplify code maintainability
- Fix memory leaks (`run->map` was leaked in some `map error` cases)

### Tests and benchmark mode updates

- Added `make test` command to automatically run tests
- Added `make bench` rule to `Makefile` to make bench running easier
	- Automatically runs `make test` before starting the bench
- Updated command used to run benchmark to improve **timings accuracy**
	- Old command = `./bsq --bench tests/test_10000 > /dev/null`
	- New command = `sudo caffeinate nice -n -20 ./bsq --bench tests/test_10000 > /dev/null`
- Removed **individual** run timings for a more readable output
- Added `CLOCK_BENCH` conditionnal definition to `bench.h` to improve **timings accuracy**
	- Changed `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` to `CLOCK_UPTIME_RAW` for macOS
	- Changed `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` to `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` for Linux

### Refactorizations

- Moved the `BUFFER_SIZE` definition from `types.h` to `read.h`
- Moved `RULES_MIN_LEN` and `RULES_CHARSET_LEN` definitions from `types.h` to `parse_rules.h`
- Added a `VERSION` definition to `bsq.h`
- Split `parse.c` into `parse_rules.c` and `parse_map.c` for _42 norm_ compliance (5 functions max per file)
