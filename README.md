## 🪄 Highlights

- **_Dynamic growth_ I/O buffer**: reduces the number of `read` system calls  
- **Unified parsing and solving**: single-pass computation combining map validation and `dp` update 
- **Flat memory layouts**: reduce data access time, memory usage, and copy overhead  
- **Single-row array _dynamic programming_ layout**: improves memory footprint and L1 cache locality.
- **In-place editing of the original map**: avoids full map copies and checks  
- **One-time output**: avoids multiple `write` system calls  
- **Integrated tests** with the `make test` command
- **Integrated benchmark** (100 iterations) with the `make bench` command

## 🚀 Performance
- A 10,000×10,000 map is processed in less than **80 ms**

> _Measured on macOS (Apple M4) using `<time.h>` / `clock_gettime()`_
> 
> _`stdout` redirected to `/dev/null` to eliminate potential shell or terminal I/O bottlenecks_

## 🎓 **Context**

The **BSQ (Biggest Square)** is the final algorithmic project of the **42 Paris Piscine**.  
Its goal is to parse a text-based map - from file(s) or stdin - and compute the largest possible empty square, following the official 42 C **Norm v4**.

This project is a deep dive into:
- **_Dynamic programming_** for **2D optimization problems**  
- **Execution time optimization** using **low-level CPU profiling** and **micro-optimization techniques**
- **Memory management and I/O efficiency**  
- **Strict compliance** with the **42 Norm**

---

## ⚙️ **Objective**

- Read maps from one or more **files**, or directly from **stdin**  
- Detect invalid or corrupted maps (missing lines, inconsistent width, invalid characters, etc.)  
- Efficiently compute the **largest empty square**, even on large maps (e.g. 10k×10k)  
- Output the map with the square marked using the `filled` character

---

## 🧩 **Algorithm**

The program implements a **dynamic programming** approach:
1. Each cell represents the size of the largest square ending at that point.  
2. The recurrence relation:
```c
if (map[row][col] == EMPTY)
	dp[row][col] = 1 + min(dp[row-1][col], dp[row][col-1], dp[row-1][col-1]);
else
	dp[row][col] = 0;
```
3. The largest value found indicates the **size and position** of the biggest square.

> _For performance reasons, the first row and the first column of each row are computed by dedicated functions: `parse_row_0()` and `parse_col_0()`._
>
> _Additionally, the `dp` is implemented using a single-row array and a temporary value (representing the up-left cell: `dp[row-1][col-1]`)._
>
> _The 2D relation above is shown for clarity, as the actual implementation uses a 1D array for better memory locality._

> _For experimental branchless versions of the DP computation, see [branchless_comparison.md](branchless_comparison.md)._
>
> _This file documents the _bitmask-based_ and _XOR-based_ approaches I tested to minimize _branch mispredictions_, and explains why it didn't produce the expected results._
