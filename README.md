## 🪄 Highlights

- **_Dynamic growth_ I/O buffer**: reduces the number of `read` system calls  
- **Unified parsing and solving**: single-pass computation  
- **Flat memory layouts**: reduce data access time, memory usage, and copy overhead  
- **Flat _dynamic programming_ table**: reduces computation time  
- **In-place editing of the original map**: avoids full map copies and checks  
- **One-time output**: avoids multiple `write` system calls  
- **Integrated benchmark** (10 iterations) with the `--bench` flag as the first argument

---

## 🚀 Performance
- A 10 000×10 000 map is processed in **~200 ms**

> _Measured on macOS / Apple M4 / `<time.h>` / `clock_gettime()`_
> 
> _`stdout` redirected to `/dev/null` to eliminate potential shell or terminal I/O bottlenecks_

| Version | Description | Real Time (10k×10k map) |
|----------|-------------|------------------------------|
| **v1.1.0 (Piscine)** | Baseline (string join, naïve I/O) | ~37 000 ms |
| **v1.2.0** | Added output buffer (`char **`) | ~5 800 ms |
| **v1.3.0** | Switched output to flat buffer (`char *`) | ~5 600 ms |
| **v1.4.0** | Removed initialization loops | ~5 400 ms |
| **v2.0.0** | Simplified data structures, unified parsing and solving, optimized flat I/O buffers, flattened map and DP arrays | ~320 ms |
| **v2.1.0** | Output optimization: only updates the required characters directly in the original map | ~250 ms |
| **v2.1.1** | Integrated benchmark mode (10 iterations) with the `--bench` flag as the first argument | ~200 ms |

## 🎓 **Context**

The **BSQ (Biggest Square)** is the final algorithmic project of the **42 Paris Piscine**.  
Its goal is to parse a text-based map - from file(s) or stdin - and compute the largest possible empty square, following the official 42 C **Norm v4**.

This project is a deep dive into:
- **Dynamic programming** for 2D optimization problems  
- **Memory management and I/O efficiency**  
- **Strict compliance** with the **42 Norm**

---

## ⚙️ **Objective**

- Read maps from one or more **files**, or directly from **stdin**  
- Detect invalid or corrupted maps (missing lines, inconsistent width, invalid characters, etc.)  
- Efficiently compute the **largest empty square**, even on large maps (e.g. 10k×10k)  
- Output the map with the square marked using the `filled` character

---

## 🧩 **Algorithm**

The program implements a **dynamic programming** approach:
1. Each cell represents the size of the largest square ending at that point.  
2. The recurrence relation:
```c
if (map[row][col] == empty)
	dp[row][col] = 1 + min(dp[row-1][col], dp[row][col-1], dp[row-1][col-1]);
else
	dp[row][col] = 0;
```
3. The largest value found indicates the **size and position** of the biggest square.

## 🧰 **Build and Run**

### Compilation
```bash
# Compiles the standard binary
make

# Compiles the fast binary
make fast

# Compiles the (sometimes) faster binary
make sfast
```

### Run with one or more files
```bash
./bsq file_path_1 file_path_2 ... file_path_n
```

### Run with stdin
⚠️ This feature has been removed from v2.0.0.
Coming back soon...
```bash
cat tests/basic_test | ./bsq
```

### Run automatic benchmark
- Automatically runs 10 iterations with the file given as the second argument
- Displays (on `stderr`) the timings of each run and their average
> _Bench output is printed to `stderr`_
> 
> _Redirect `stdout` to `/dev/null` to eliminate potential shell or terminal I/O bottlenecks_
```bash
./bsq --bench file_path > /dev/null
```

### Clean build files
```bash
# Only clean objects
make clean

# Clean objects and binary
make fclean
```
